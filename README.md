# Deis Chart Repository

|![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Warning.svg/156px-Warning.svg.png) | Kubernetes Helm has replaced Helm Classic. The charts in this repository are now deprecated. Workflow v2.9.0 will be the last release installable with Helm Classic (helmc). |
|---|---|

* For help migrating from Helm Classic to Kubernetes Helm see <https://github.com/deis/workflow-migration#workflow-migration>
* For general installation instructions see <https://deis.com/docs/workflow/installing-workflow/>

## Contributing

First, add this Chart repo to Helm Classic to install the current "workflow-dev" chart:

### Prerequisites

You must enable the extensions api for your kube-apiserver. For now the only requirement is that the daemonsets portion of the api be enabled. To do this add the following line to the script that starts your api server:

```console
--runtime-config=extensions/v1beta1=true,extensions/v1beta1/daemonsets=true
```

you can also do `ENABLE_DAEMONSETS=true` before running the `kube-up.sh` script.

### Installation

First, add this Chart repo to Helm Classic to install the "workflow" chart:

```console
$ helmc repo add deis https://github.com/deis/charts
$ helmc up
$ helmc fetch deis/workflow-dev
$ helmc generate workflow-dev  # creates the required secrets
$ helmc install workflow-dev
$ kubectl --namespace=deis get pods -w # watch this until all pods show "Running"
$ kubectl --namespace=deis get svc deis-router
# note the "EXTERNAL_IP" field for IP address on GKE/GCE/AWS, on Vagrant look for an "IP(S)"
```

Then install the `deis` client, register yourself as a user and create your first application:

```console
$ curl -sSL http://deis.io/deis-cli/install-v2.sh | bash
$ export PATH=.:$PATH
$ deis register deis.IP_YOU_GOT_ABOVE.xip.io  # register as the first user
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@deis.com"
$ eval $(ssh-agent) && ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
$ deis keys:add ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Now let's create an App:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/deis/example-go.git
$ cd example-go
$ deis create mytest
Creating Application... done, created madras-radiator
$ git push deis master
Creating build... ..o
$ deis open
$ deis scale web=3 -a mytest # to scale up the app
```
