# Workflow v2.9.0

NOTE: Kubernetes Helm has replaced Helm classic, so these charts are deprecated.
Workflow v2.9.0 will be the last release installable with Helm classic (helmc).
See https://github.com/deis/workflow-migration#workflow-migration for help upgrading
to Kubernetes Helm, and see https://deis.com/docs/workflow/installing-workflow/ for
general installation instructions.
